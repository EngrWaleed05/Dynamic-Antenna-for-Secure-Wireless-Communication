# Dynamic Antenna for Secure Wireless Communication

This repository contains the design and simulation of a **Dynamic Antenna** for secure wireless communication.  
The antenna creates a **static radiation pattern** in the desired receiver direction, while generating **dynamic, distorted patterns** in all other directions by switching between dual feed points and applying phase/amplitude modulation.
